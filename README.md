# jqSlider

Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery, create a number line with two draggable points. The number line should have:
• A horizontal line with 11 tick marks labeled from -5 to 5.
• Have two points that are draggable along the horizontal line. The user should not be able to
drag the points off of or outside of the horizontal line.
• The user cannot drag and place the points in between two tick marks. Instead, points will snap
to the closest tick mark.
• Highlight the area between the two points with a bold line.
